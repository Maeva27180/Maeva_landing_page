		<h2>Step #1 - Raw materials</h2>
		<p>
			The first thing that you require to create candles are raw materials like candle wax in pellets. 
		</p>

			<p>
				I recommend you to take only white Beeswax or Soywax to begin with. Soy and Bees waxes are non threatening for the environment and yourself, and are easy-to-use waxes. 
			</p>

		<h2>Step #2 - Make sure that you have everything you need</h2>
			<p>
				Here is the supply list that you will need: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>One package of candle-making soy wax or white Bees wax<li>
					<li>One glass heat-resistant jar</li>
					<li>One package of large candle wicks</li>
					<li>One bottle of fragrance oil</li>
					<li>One spatula</li>
					<li>One heat-proof container</li>
					<li>One double-boiler</li>
					<li>One thermometer</li>
					<li>One pair of chopsticks or pencils</li>

				</ul>
	</div>

<div>
	<h2>Step #3 - Measure the wax</h2>
		<p>
			Make sure you have a clean and flat surface to work on. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To know how much wax you need to melt: measure how much wax you need to fill your container, then double it.  
		</p>

<div>
	<h2>Step #4 - Melt the wax</h2>
		<p>
			Pour the wax into your double boiler and let it melt for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure to stir frequently. 
		</p>

<div>
	<h2>Step #5 - Add fragrance oils (optional)</h2>
		<p>
			While this step is optional, we recommand you to take a lovely floral smell. 
		</p>

		<P>
			When your candle wax is melted, it means that it's time to add your fragrance oils. 
		</P>

		<P>To know how much fragrance you have to pour into your melted wax, you just have to follow the instructions on you wax package. Then, simply put the fragrance into your melted wax and stir for a few seconds. 
		</p>

<h2>Step #6 - Pour the wax in the container</h2>

<p>
	Before you pour the wax into your container, let it cool for a few minutes. You need to check the temperature, and follow the instructions on the wax package. As each wax is "unique", following the instructions on the wax package is the best way to have a perfect candle at the end! 
</p>

	<P>
		Usually, it is time to pour the wax when the thermometer reads 140Â°C. 
	</p>

			<p>
				Make sure to pour the wax gently and slowly to avoid air bubbles into your candle. While pouring, hold the wick in place, but don't pull it. 
			</p>

				<p>
					Leave a small amount of wax in the boiler for topping of your candle later. 
				</p>

<div>
	<h2>Step #7 - Secure the wick</h2>

		<p>
			To make sure you wick stays in the right position while your melted wax is cooling in the candle jar, secure the wick with 2 chopsticks, like on the picture shown below
		</p>

				<p>
					Let the wax set for at least 4 hours at room temperature.
				</p>
</div>


<div>
	<h2>Step #8 - Add more wax</h2>

		<p>
			Once your wax has set, if you see that the top has some cracks or holes, simply reheat the wax left in the boiler, and add it on the top of your candle. 
		</p>

<div>
	<h2>Step #9 - Cut the wick</h2>

		<p>
			Your candle wick should not be longer that half an inch. You can trim the wick when you see that the candle flitters while it is lit, or that the wick is too long. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now that you know how to create a candle, you are able to create many varieties of candles for yourself or as a gift for a friend. You can also add dry flowers or decorative items on the top of your candles to make it more special.
